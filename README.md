# Employee-Burnout-Analysis
The Employee Burnout Prediction App, built with Python and Streamlit, predicts burnout using SVM regression. Users upload datasets (Excel/CSV), processed to remove missing values and encode features. It shows correlations, forecasts burnout, and evaluates performance with MSE, RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
